# 📊 Revenue-Leakage-Profitability-Analysis
Consulting-style data analytics project analyzing revenue leakage and profitability across products, regions, and customers using SQL, Python, and Power BI. Identifies margin erosion from discounts, returns, and costs, delivering executive-level insights and actionable recommendations.

#  Executive Summary
Organizations often experience declining profitability despite steady revenue growth due to hidden inefficiencies known as **revenue leakage**.  
This project simulates a **Big-4 consulting engagement**, identifying revenue leakage drivers and evaluating true profitability across products, regions, and customers using data-driven analysis.


# Business Objectives
- Identify and quantify **revenue leakage sources**
- Measure **true profitability beyond topline revenue**
- Analyze margins across **products, regions, and customers**
- Enable **data-driven cost optimization and pricing decisions**
- Deliver **executive-level insights for leadership**

# Problem Statement
Despite stable sales volumes, the organization is facing **declining net margins**.  
Management lacks visibility into how discounts, returns, and operational costs impact profitability and which business segments are eroding profit.


# Key Business Questions
- Which products generate high revenue but low or negative profit?
- What percentage of revenue is lost due to discounts and returns?
- Which regions and customers contribute most to margin erosion?
- What are the top drivers causing revenue leakage?
- How can profitability be improved without increasing sales volume?


# Dataset Overview
- Transaction-level retail sales dataset
- Includes orders, customers, products, regions, discounts, and profit

> **Consulting Simulation:**  
> Missing cost and logistics components were engineered using business assumptions to reflect real-world enterprise data environments.

# Analytical Approach
# 1️⃣ Data Preparation
- Cleaned and validated transactional data  
- Created derived financial metrics (Net Revenue, Total Cost, Net Profit)

### 2️⃣ Revenue Leakage Analysis
Identified leakage from:
- Excessive discounting  
- High return rates  
- Loss-making transactions  
- Operational and logistics cost overruns  

### 3️⃣ Profitability Analysis
- Product-level margin analysis  
- Region-wise profitability comparison  
- Customer-level profit contribution analysis  

### 4️⃣ Root Cause Analysis
- Pareto (80/20) analysis  
- Contribution & waterfall analysis  

### 5️⃣ Executive Reporting
- Dashboard-driven insights aligned with CXO decision-making
