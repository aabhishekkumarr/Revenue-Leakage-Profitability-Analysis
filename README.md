#  Revenue-Leakage-Profitability-Analysis
Consulting-style data analytics project analyzing revenue leakage and profitability across products, regions, and customers using SQL, Python, and Power BI. Identifies margin erosion from discounts, returns, and costs, delivering executive-level insights and actionable recommendations.

#  Executive Summary
Organizations often experience declining profitability despite steady revenue growth due to hidden inefficiencies known as **revenue leakage**.  
This project simulates a **Big-4 consulting engagement**, identifying revenue leakage drivers and evaluating true profitability across products, regions, and customers using data-driven analysis.


# Business Objectives
- Identify and quantify **revenue leakage sources**
- Measure **true profitability beyond topline revenue**
- Analyze margins across **products, regions, and customers**
- Enable **data-driven cost optimization and pricing decisions**
- Deliver **executive-level insights for leadership**

# Problem Statement
Despite stable sales volumes, the organization is facing **declining net margins**.  
Management lacks visibility into how discounts, returns, and operational costs impact profitability and which business segments are eroding profit.


# Key Business Questions
- Which products generate high revenue but low or negative profit?
- What percentage of revenue is lost due to discounts and returns?
- Which regions and customers contribute most to margin erosion?
- What are the top drivers causing revenue leakage?
- How can profitability be improved without increasing sales volume?


# Dataset Overview
- Transaction-level retail sales dataset
- Includes orders, customers, products, regions, discounts, and profit

 # Consulting Simulation:  
> Missing cost and logistics components were engineered using business assumptions to reflect real-world enterprise data environments.


# Key KPIs & Metrics
- Gross Revenue & Net Revenue  
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)  
- Discount & Logistics Cost  
- Gross Margin (%) & Net Margin (%)  
- Revenue Leakage (%)  
- Profit per Order  
- Customer Profitability  


# Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Revenue leakage identification & margin analysis  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning & profitability modeling  
- **Power BI / Tableau** – Executive dashboards & storytelling  
- **Excel** – Data validation & exploratory analysis  



# Analytical Approach
#  Data Preparation
- Cleaned and validated transactional data  
- Created derived financial metrics (Net Revenue, Total Cost, Net Profit)

# Revenue Leakage Analysis
Identified leakage from:
- Excessive discounting  
- High return rates  
- Loss-making transactions  
- Operational and logistics cost overruns  

## Profitability Analysis
- Product-level margin analysis  
- Region-wise profitability comparison  
- Customer-level profit contribution analysis  

## Root Cause Analysis
- Pareto (80/20) analysis  
- Contribution & waterfall analysis  

## Executive Reporting
- Dashboard-driven insights aligned with CXO decision-making  



##  Dashboard Highlights
- Revenue vs Net Profit comparison  
- Revenue Leakage Breakdown  
- Top Loss-Making Products & Customers  
- Region-wise Margin Heatmap  
- High-Risk Revenue Leakage Indicators  



# Key Insights
- Identified ~18% revenue leakage driven by discounts, returns, and logistics inefficiencies  
- Several high-revenue products were net loss-making after cost allocation  
- A small subset of customers contributed disproportionately to margin erosion  
- Profit leakage was concentrated in specific regions and categories  



# Strategic Recommendations
- Optimize discount thresholds for low-margin products  
- Reprice or discontinue bottom-performing SKUs  
- Renegotiate logistics costs in loss-heavy regions  
- Introduce minimum order value policies for high-return customers  
- Apply profitability-based customer segmentation  



# Business Impact
- Improved transparency into hidden revenue losses  
- Enabled leadership to prioritize high-impact corrective actions  
- Demonstrated how analytics directly supports financial decision-making  



# Future Enhancements
- Predictive models for early revenue leakage detection  
- Pricing optimization using scenario analysis  
- Customer lifetime value (CLV) integration  
- Real-time profitability dashboards
